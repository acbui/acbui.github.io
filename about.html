        <p>
            Anh Chi first started making games by participating at 36- to 48-hour game jams, the first of which was <a href="http://tag.hexagram.ca/events/gamerella/">GAMERella</a> (November 2013) where she made <a href="http://acbui.tumblr.com">pixel art</a> for Nanuq, an alchemy-themed platformer about the last polar bear on Earth.
        </p> 
        <p>
            In March 2014, she was a programmer at the <a href="http://tag.hexagram.ca/events/ch-prejam/">Critical Hit PRE-JAM</a> where she coded for Escape the Experiment, a game about a scientist using his hybrid vehicle to escape his creature. 
        </p>
        <h4><a href="http://pixelles.ca">P I X E L L E S</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>( J A N U A R Y - F E B R U A R Y&nbsp;&nbsp;2 0 1 4 )</i></h4>
        <p>
            She was one of 10 women selected to participate in the second iteration of the Pixelles Incubator, a 6-week incubator encouraging women to make their first game on their own. Pixelles held weekly meetups where women working various jobs in the games industry came to speak of their experience. 
        </p>
        <p>
            She coded and made the <a href="http://acbui.tumblr.com">assets</a> for a pixel art sidescrolling runner Here Kitty Kitty! which she showed at the <a href="http://www.montrealjoue.ca/?com=detail&eID=370690">Festival Montr√©al Joue Foire du jeu</a> (February 2014), the <a href="http://pixelles.ca/blog/2014/03/play-the-games-from-our-2nd-showcase">Pixelles Showcase</a> (February 2014), and the <a href="http://mrgs.ca/2014/03/mar-resume-mar/">Mount-Royal Game Society (MRGS) March Meetup</a> (March 2014). 
        </p>

        <h4><a href="http://criticalhitmontreal.ca">C R I T I C A L&nbsp;&nbsp;H I T</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>( J U N E - A U G U S T&nbsp;&nbsp;2 0 1 4 )</i></h4>
        <p>
            Along with 15 other participants with different backgrounds and skillsets, Anh Chi was chosen as a programmer for the second iteration of the Critical Hit Games Collaboratory, a 10-week incubator focused on the concept of game jams.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the first 4 weeks, she worked on many games during the "slow jam" phase (week-long themed game jam where the participants were required to work full-time on their game in the TAG lab space provided to them). The <a href="http://www.criticalhitmontreal.ca/games/">jam games</a> from weeks 1 to 4 were showcased at the <a href="http://www.criticalhitmontreal.ca/midsummer-nights-playtest/">Midsummer Playtest Party</a> (July 2014). 
        </p>
        <p>
            For the polish phase of CH, Anh Chi worked with Brooklyn-based game maker <a href="http://wsong.me/">Winnie Song</a> (a Game Design MFA student at NYU Game Center with a BFA in Graphic Design and Expanded Animation from OCAD) on DrunkWalk which was featured and available to play (along with the five other polished games) at the <a href="http://www.criticalhitmontreal.ca/final-showcase-thank/">Final Showcase</a> hosted at Google.
